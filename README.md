**Anagrams**
 
 Return true of false depends on provided strings are anagrams of eachother.
 One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters
 in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces
 or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case.
 
 Examples:
 ```javascript
  anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') === true
  anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') === true
  anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') === false
 ```



**Array Chunk**
 
 For given array and chunk size, divide the array into many subarrays
 where each subarray is of length chunk size.
 
  Examples:
  ```javascript
  chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) === [[ 1, 2], [3, 4]]
  chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) === [[ 1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
  chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 3) === [[ 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]
  chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) === [[ 1, 2, 3, 4], [5]]
  chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10) === [[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
  ```
 


 **Capitalize**
 
  Write a function that accepts a string. The function should
  capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then
  return the capitalized string.
 
  Examples:
  ```javascript
  capitalize('a short sentence') === 'A Short Sentence'
  capitalize('a lazy fox') === 'A Lazy Fox'
  capitalize('look, it is working!') === 'Look, It Is Working!'
 ```



 **Fib**
 
  Write a function which print out the n-th entry in the fibonacci series.
  The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where
  each number is the sum of the preceeding two.
  
  ```javascript
  Example sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
 
  Examples:
  fib(4) === 3
  fib(15) === 610
  ```
 



**Fizz Buzz**
 
  Write a program that console logs the numbers
  from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
 “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples
  of five prints “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples
  of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.
 
Example:
```javascript
  fizzBuzz(5);
  console.log(1)
  console.log(2)
  console.log('fizz')
  console.log(4)
  console.log('buzz')
  ```
 


**Palindrome**
 
 For given string return true if the string is a palindrome
 or false if it is not.
 
  Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed.
  Include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string
  is a palindrome.
 
  Examples:
  ```javascript
  palindrome("abba") === true
  palindrome("abcdefg") === false
  ```

**Vowels**

  Write a function which returns number of vowels in given string.
 
  Examples:
  ```javscript
  vowels('aeiou') === 5
  vowels('Adam') === 2
  vowels('Hello there!') === 4
  ```

**Reverse String**
 
  For given string return a new string
  with the reversed order of characters.
 
 Examples:
 ```javascript
 reverse('apple') === 'elppa'
 reverse('hello') === 'olleh'
 reverse('Greetings!') === '!sgniteerG'
 ```
